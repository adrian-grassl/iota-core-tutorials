### Description
- This is a collection of tutorials, how to's and code examples to showcase several components and use case patterns of the IOTA Core Protocol

### Dependancies
- On a protocol level, the examples need to interact with a **Stardust** Tangle
- You shouldn't expect a public node to expose the necessary endpoints, therefor running either your own node in a public network (alpha/test/main) or a private Tangle is recommended
- The private Tangle setup used for the development of this collection, can be found on the develop branch of the [Hornet](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet/tree/develop/private_tangle) repo
